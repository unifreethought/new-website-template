			<h2><a href="#">Fursdays wif Stef #26</a></h2>
			<span class="blog-post-author">Posted By <a href="#">Stef McGraw</a> on {Day}, March 30th, 2011</span>
			<p>If you were on UNI's campus this past fall, you probably remember an organization called "One Iowa." Heck, you may have even volunteered for it. For those of you who don't know though, it's the state's top LGBT rights organization, and those associated with it work tirelessly trying to ensure that same-sex marriage stays in Iowa through education, phone calls, voter registration, canvassing, etc. As a member of the executive board for UNI's chapter this past election season, I got to learn first hand what it takes to try and get people on board with voting in support of gay marriage, and got to see how successful One Iowa is at bringing people together to accomplish this goal.</p>

			<p>That said, I don't agree with all their appeals. This week's One Iowa newsletter included a story entitled "Focus on Faith: I'm Proof God Changes Hearts and Minds." Not only do I take issue with actively promoting the idea that gay rights can fit in with faith, but this man's story especially infuriates me (I'll elaborate later). If you're too busy/lazy to read (though I suggest you do), here's a summary: A former pastor tells how he used to be a Biblical literalist who preached strongly against homosexuality. Then, through several things such as reading up on unfamiliar theology, educating himself on different modes of Biblical interpretation, reading a book by Pope John Paul II, meeting gay people, and, supposedly through the prayer of his wife, he changed his views. He quit his job and converted to Catholicism, which he considers a major part of why he now believes in equal rights.</p>

			<p>Give me a break. Being a Christian still has nothing to do with the shedding of his bigotry; it has everything to do with the fact that he actually educated himself and started thinking about human rights. I think I can safely say that religion almost never brings anyone to civil rights, and rather that religion almost always is the reason behind gay hate.</p>

			<p>Now, let me be clear: when it comes to supporting civil rights, I don't care what people's religious views are. Sure, I certainly think it's far better to be non-religious, but the fight to keep gay marriage in Iowa (and secure it in most other states, for that matter) is a far too important a cause for us to get caught up in religious differences. But for One Iowa to appeal especially to the religious is ultimately harmful to the cause. The lesson shouldn't be, "look, supporting civil rights can squeeze into your faith because you can interpret the Bible in this way!" Rather, it should be, "look, supporting civil rights is a moral issue, and you'd be wrong to not support it regardless of your religious views." To emphasize the fact that religion and civil justice can be compatible is to actively support the very institution from which the vast majority of bigotry is derived. One Iowa should focus far more on the fact that being a well-educated, empathetic, moral person is how one comes to support gay marriage, NOT on the fact that the Bible could, perhaps, if read a certain way, support it. It shouldn't matter one bit what the Bible says, because if the Bible could not possibly be made out to support homosexuality, One Iowa would obviously not be emphasizing it, and would still be equally in support of gay marriage.</p>

			<p>But it's not just this accomodationalist, hypocritical approach that disappoints me. One Iowa also chose poorly on who specifically to use in their appeal to the religious. This man's commitment to gay rights first, remains unconvincing in my opinion: "Then, about two years ago, I was having a difficult time find a good barber in our small town. My wife suggested her hair dresser who I knew to be gay. Well, with some reluctance I went, and now he is not only the only barber I will go to, I also consider him a good friend."</p>

			<p>So...you go to a gay barber. GREAT. But second, and most disturbing, is what he says directly after his barber story: "I must add that the most powerful weapon we possess to tear down these walls of religion discrimination is that of prayer."</p>

			<p>...WHAT? So, all the work that One Iowa does, not important as just thinking about change. I don't even need to explain what's wrong with that, and how it goes COMPLETELY against what One Iowa stands for.</p>

			<p>In the fight for gay rights, yeah, it's okay to include the religious, but religion itself should NOT become a part of the movement. Until One Iowa and similar groups realize this, I'm afraid it'll be quite difficult to get past the very counter-productive and frankly unimportant "how to accommodate religion" discussion.</p>

			<h2><a href="#">24/7 Service Week</a></h2>
			<span class="blog-post-author">Posted By <a href="#">Quinn Jones</a> on {Day}, March 29th, 2011</span>
			<br />
			<span class="right"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-C4g_RHwq1Mk/TZNoPRH6I0I/AAAAAAAADQo/NvLskt9RuWM/s320/Service+Week+picture.jpg" /></span>
			<p>During the week of April 14th-21st, the religious community here at UNI will be hosting 24/7 Prayer Week. Their goal is for students to pray continuously throughout the week at the Lutheran Student Center, creating an entire week of non-stop prayer.</p>

			<p>As members of the UNI Freethinkers and Inquirers, we recognize that prayer doesn’t have any tangible impact on the world. Instead of spending our time praying, we’d rather do something that would have a real, tangible impact. We have decided to create a 24/7 Service Week event to encourage people to give back to their community “24/7” during this week, whether it be volunteering for an organization or simply doing a good deed for a stranger. To help you out, we’ve put together a schedule of service projects for each day of the week that we are sponsoring. We encourage people to participate in service week through our events, or find your own ways to make a difference in the community!</p>

			<p>We’d like to invite anyone (religious or non-religious) interested to join us for any of these events by filling out the form below. Please let us know your availability as soon as possible since some of these events have a limited number of spots available. Details about individual events are located below the form. Email us at service@unifreethought.com with any questions!</p>

			<h2><a href="#">What, what, what are you doing?</a></h2>
			<span class="blog-post-author">Posted By <a href="#">Trevor Boeckman</a> on {Day}, March 23rd, 2011</span>
			<p>This week has been dubbed "A" week by...someone. I'm not exactly sure how it started, but the movement has gained traction on Facebook. The idea is this: change your profile picture to an "A" for the week to come out and show how many atheists there are on Facebook.

The principle behind the event is a good one. When you can create an "us" vs. "them" mentality, it's really easy to demonize another group. When you realize "them" are your neighbors, friends, and family, it becomes a lot harder. Harvey Milk, advocating for gay rights, is portrayed in a memorable "Milk" scene saying "if they know us, they don't vote against us." The same is true of bringing atheism to the mainstream. If they know us, they don't vote against us.

So, it should be a powerful movement when I see this on Facebook, right?

			<p>Well, it would be -- except here are what the people we're trying to win over are saying:</p>
			
			<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-jpC2bdAc2is/TYfvyQHxzHI/AAAAAAAAAOw/cyQZNPzcF-w/s1600/andrea+chat.PNG" />
			
			<p>No one outside of our movement knows what the "A" means. Yes, some people will look up what's going on. Most won't.

Want to actually help help with the movement? Grab a sheet of paper, write that you're an atheist, and make that your profile picture. Hell, give us a link to it. Lets put these pictures around campus! Lets make a video! Lets actually out ourselves and show this campus how many atheists they know. A symbol is nice. A face is better.

Seriously, lets do this. Don't have a camera? Markers? A pen? My phone number is in the contact page. Send me a text and I'll bring them to you. Let me kick this off. This is what an atheist looks like.

			<h2><a href="#">Announcing UNIFI's Vice President for 2011-2012</a></h2>
			<span class="blog-post-author">Posted By <a href="#">Cory Derringer</a> on {Day}, March 23rd, 2011</span>
			<p>I want to start by thanking Trevor for appointing me as the next UNIFI President. It's been a pleasure working under and learning from Trevor for the last two years, and I hope next year we can take the group he revolutionized to even greater heights.</p>

			<p>I'm writing this post to announce a change in the makeup of the officer core for next year. The relationship between each of the positions has in the past been left undefined: everyone answered to the president. This accomplished two things: it allowed the group a certain flexibility, and it took advantage of Trevor's considerable leadership abilities.</p>

			<p>Next year, I want the officer core to be led by a President-Vice President team. In essence, I'm expanding the role of Vice President. Because the Vice President will be more involved in decision making and have more authority than in the past, I have decided to select this officer first so that he/she may be involved in the selection of the other three officers and the revitalized chair positions, as well as the development of any other structural changes to the officer core. (I'll publish a post with more detail when the applications become available in the near future.)</p>

			<p>With that said, I have selected my Vice President for next year: Michael Dippold.</p>

			<p>I am confident both in the decision to change the relationship between the Vice President and the rest of the officer core, and the selection I have made for the position. If anyone has questions about this process or suggestions for next year, I urge you to email me at cory@unifreethought.com.</p>

			<p>Congratulations, Mr. Dippold. I look forward to working with you, and I am confident in our ability to continue to make steady progress for UNIFI in the year to come.</p>

			<h2><a href="#">Announcing UNIFI's Next President</a></h2>
			<span class="blog-post-author">Posted By <a href="#">Trevor Boeckman</a> on {Day}, March 23rd, 2011</span>
			<p>For the past two years, I've had the honor of serving as UNIFI's President. I've been proud of the work that I've accomplished along with our officers and members. We've started something great with this group, and I have no doubt it will continue in the coming years.</p>
			
			<p>However, it won't continue with me. This May, I'll be graduating and moving to attend law school. Our constitution gives the President the power to appoint a successor every year on March 15th. The newly appointed President will spend a month organizing next year's leadership and then, on April 15th, will officially take over the group.</p>
			
			<p>I am honored to announce the appointment of UNIFI's next President: Cory Derringer.</p>
			
			<p>Cory has served as my Vice President for the past two years and is one of the most dedicated, knowledgeable, and hard-working members of the group. I have suspected from the day I became President that he would be my successor. Cory has been responsible for the creation of Faith Forum, the re-vitalization of the blog, and the STAR program at Cedar Falls High School. He organized  this year's Darwin Week faculty speakers and was an excellent partner is our Darwin Week debate. I'm excited to see Cory continue to develop collaborative events with religious groups on campus -- it's an area where he excels, and I'm, admittedly, a bit lackluster.</p>
			
			<p>Want to be a part of the new Derringer administration? Over the next few weeks, be on the lookout for announcements on how to be a part of next year's leadership team. Feel free to contact Cory with any questions.</p>
			
			<p>Again, congratulations Cory. I've loved having you as my Vice President, and I look forward to seeing what you'll do with the new job.</p>
